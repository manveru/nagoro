= About Nagoro

Nagoro is a templating engine for XHTML based on REXML.
It featues a modular code layout and is used in the Ramaze web framework.

Nagoro consists of a series of so-called pipes that are mainly run through
REXML::Document::parse_stream to produce valid ruby from the templates that are
eventually evaluated with custom binding.

All functionality of Nagoro is carefully tested by a series of rspecs to avoid
breakage and give a good overview of nagoros capabilities.

= Features Overview

* Pipes

  Pipes are pluggable subclasses of Nagoro::Pipe::Base or respond to ::process
  and the returned value should provide a #to_html method.

  * Element

    Elements are tags that correspond to classes.

  * Include

    Transforms <include href="file" /> tags, file is passed to Kernel::open and
    so you can even include remote locations if you require 'open-uri'

  * Instruction

    Instructions have a syntax of <?name instruction?>, most common is
    <?r code ?> to evaluate ruby code without outputting it.

  * Localization

    Not based on Pipe::Base, processes the template by a regular expression and
    substitutes keys with localized strings.

  * Morph

    Custom tag parameters like <div if="cond">condition is fulfilled</div>


= Installation

* Rubygems

  The easiest way of installing Nagoro is by:

    $ gem install nagoro

  Make sure you have the necessary privileges to execute the command.
  Rubygems can be found at http://rubygems.org

* Darcs

  To get the latest version of nagoro, you can just pull from the repository
  and use it this way.

    $ darcs get --partial http://manveru.net/nagoro

  Please read the `man darcs` or `darcs help` for more information about
  updating and creating your own patches.
  This is usually only needed for developers as the implementation of nagoro is
  not rapidly changing and releases are made after every major change.

  Some hints for the usage of Darcs

  * Use require 'nagoro' from anywhere

    Add a file to your site_ruby named 'nagoro.rb'
    the content should be:

      require '/path/to/darcs/repo/nagoro/lib/nagoro'

  * Get the latest version (from inside the nagoro directory)

    $ darcs pull

  * Recording a patch

    $ darcs record

  * output your patches into a bundle ready to be mailed (compress it before
    sending to make sure it arrives in the way you sent it)

  $ darcs send -o nagoro.dpatch
  $ gzip -c nagoro.dpatch > nagoro.dpatch.gz


= Getting started

See the installation section for how to install nagoro.
After installation you can use nagoro in a couple of ways

* CLI

  From commandline using the `nagoro` executable.

    $ nagoro yourfile.xhtml

* In Ruby

  Using Nagoro::render_file

    nagoro = Nagoro.render_file('yourfile.xhtml')
    xhtml = nagoro.result(binding)
    puts xhtml

  Using Nagoro::render

    nagoro = Nagoro.render('<?r a = 42 ?>#{a * 42}')
    xhtml = nagoro.result(binding)
    puts xhtml

  Using Nagoro::render with filename, useful because it shows up in backtraces.

    nagoro = Nagoro.render('<?r a = 42 ?>#{a * 42}', :file => 'foo.xhtml')
    xhtml = nagoro.result(binding)
    puts xhtml

= About REXML

REXML is a _pure_ Ruby, XML 1.0 conforming, non-validating toolkit with an
intuitive API.  REXML passes 100% of the non-validating Oasis tests, and
provides tree, stream, SAX2, pull, and lightweight APIs.  REXML also includes a
full XPath 1.0 implementation.
Since Ruby 1.8, REXML is included in the standard Ruby distribution.


= And thanks to...

This list is by no means a full listing of all these people, but I try to
get a good coverage despite that.

* Yukihiro Matsumoto a.k.a. matz

  For giving the world Ruby and bringing joy and passion back into programming.

* Jim Weirich

  For Rake, which lifts off a lot of tasks from the shoulders of every
  developer using it.

* George Moschovitis a.k.a. gmosx

  For the Nitro web framework. Its templating engine has been the inspiration
  for nagoro.

* Johannes Buch a.k.a. Kashia

  For the first implementation of the Localization mechanism which is mostly
  ported from Ramaze.

* Sean Russell

  For REXML, it's one of the engines that drive nagoro.

* Sean Chittenden and Wai-Sun Chia

  For libxml-ruby, it's one of the engines that drive nagoro.
